# Module3-Create-and-Mint-Token
For this project, you will write a smart contract to create your own ERC20 token and deploy it using HardHat or Remix. Once deployed, you should be able to interact with it for your walk-through video. From your chosen tool, the contract owner should be able to mint tokens to a provided address and any user should be able to burn and transfer tokens.

You will upload your solution to GitHub and share a code walk-through as explained below.
