# Module 3: Types of Functions - ETH + AVAX

The project involves creating a custom ERC-20 token smart contract called RemixToken on the Ethereum blockchain. This token contract extends functionalities from OpenZeppelin libraries (ERC20, ERC20Burnable, Ownable) to provide standard token operations such as minting, burning, and ownership management. Key features include:

* Minting Tokens: Only the contract owner can mint new tokens.
* Burning Tokens: Any user can burn their own tokens, subject to approval limits.
* Transferring Tokens: Users can transfer tokens to other addresses.

## Description

The contract is designed to be deployed with an initial supply, customizable token name and symbol, and ownership structure. This README serves as a guide for developers to set up, deploy, and interact with the RemixToken contract on Ethereum.

## Getting Started
* Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager)
* Truffle
* Ganache (for local blockchain development)
* Remix IDE (optional, for online Solidity development)

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development environment running.

* Clone the repository:git clone https://github.com/your_username/your_project.git
* Navigate into the project directory and install dependencies:cd your_project
npm install

Compiling the Smart Contract
* Compile your Solidity contracts using Truffle:truffle compile

Running Tests
*Explain how to run the automated tests for this system:truffle test

### Executing program

Explain how to deploy and interact with the contract once it's deployed. Include an example scenario.

* Deployment: Deploy the contract using Truffle or Remix IDE to a local blockchain or testnet/mainnet.

Example using Truffle:truffle migrate --network development

* Interacting with the contract: Use scripts or Remix IDE to interact with deployed contracts.
